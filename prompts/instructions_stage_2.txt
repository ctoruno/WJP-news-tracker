To help you contextualize, this is the definition of the Rule of Law that we are using for the task at hand:

# Definition of the Rule of Law
The term Rule of Law refers to a system in which law is able to impose meaningful restraints on the state and individual members of the ruling elite. 
It refers to a governance principle in which all persons, institutions, and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable 
to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms 
and standards.

We extend this concept further by defining the Rule of Law as a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld. First, 
the government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law. Second, the laws are clear, publicized, stable, and fair, and protect fundamental 
rights, including the security of persons and property. Third, the process by which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced is accessible, fair, 
and efficient. Lastly, access to justice is provided by competent, independent, and ethical adjudicators, attorneys or representatives, and judicial officers 
who are of sufficient number, have adequate resources, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.

From a political science perspective, these factors draw on four basic ideas related to the relationship between the state and the civil society: the checks 
and balances on the government's power, the effectiveness of the state in performing its basic functions, participation and collaboration between the state 
and its citizens, and absence of arbitrary abuse by the authority.

Given the previous definitions, we can infer that the Rule of Law is a multidimensional concept that extends over eight basic pillars: limited government 
powers; absence of corruption; order and security; fundamental rights; open government; effective regulatory enforcement; access to civil justice; and an 
effective criminal justice.

Next, I will provide you with detailed definitions for each pillar.

# Pillars of the Rule of Law
1. Constraints on Government Powers: 
    Measures the extent to which those who govern are bound by law. It comprises the means, both constitutional and institutional, by which the powers of the 
    government and its officials and agents are limited and held accountable under the law. It also includes non-governmental checks on the government’s power, 
    such as a free and independent press. Additionally, it measures the absence of authoritarianism, which includes the accountability of the Chief Executive, 
    and its respect for checks and balances.

    In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:
    -	The active and reactive transparency of legislative bodies (senate, parliament, assemblies), its ability to impose disciplinary measures to government 
    officials, and if there is representation of disadvantaged groups, as well as citizen participation. It also measures if the opposition can express its 
    opinions and if it exercises its functions of overseeing and investigating the government.
    -	The independence of the judiciary, by means of having sufficient resources and professional judges, with adequate rights and competencies, as well as 
    its ability to impose disciplinary measures on government officials.
    -	The independence and effectiveness of oversight institutions, such as the Supreme Audit Institution or comptroller, anticorruption authority, human rights 
    institution, the office of the ombudsman, and prosecution services, as well as if civil servants are free from political pressure, and are effective in implementing 
    public policies.
    -	Whether elections are free of barriers of entry, intimidation, corruption, and criminality, in accordance with the law, with equitable access to resources, 
    free from misinformation, secure from cyberattacks and with protection of personal. It also measures the effectiveness and independence of the electoral authority.
    -	The effectiveness of non-governmental checks on the government’s power, such as the media, CSOs, political parties, activists, and citizens. It includes their 
    effective exercise of the freedoms of assembly, association, opinion, and expression, and the rights to petition and civic engagement.
    -	The accountability of the Chief Executive or the Head of Government, and its respect for the constitutional order, the law-making process, the outcome and quality 
    of elections, civil liberties, political opponents, as well as the independence of the judiciary and oversight institutions. It also measures the likelihood of 
    sanctions to officials for misconduct.
    -	Whether members of the legislature, judiciary, elected leaders or high-ranking government officials, public sector employees, and police officers, who abuse their 
    power are sanctioned for misconduct.

2. Constraints on Government Powers:
Measures the control of corruption in various forms: bribery in administrative and political proceedings, graft, embezzlement, fraud, payroll fraud, asset misappropriation 
and skimming, nepotism, favoritism, patronage, illegal campaign financing, electoral fraud and vote buying.

In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:
    -	The prevalence of bribery in the delivery of public services and regulations, as well as in the political process. 
    -	The prevalence of graft by elected officials, public sector employees, by awarding contracts without competitive bidding processes, exerting influence for their 
    private benefit, and using insider knowledge to profit.
    -	The prevalence of embezzlement or misappropriation of public funds, payroll fraud, asset misappropriation and skimming, as well as of nepotism, favoritism, 
    and patronage.
    -	The prevalence of nepotism and favoritism by elected officials, public sector employees, judges, and prosecutors. It also measures the prevalence of patronage 
    by elected officials.
    -	The prevalence of corruption in elections, including illegal campaign financing, manipulation of elections, and vote buying.

3. Open Government
Measures the openness of government defined by the extent to which a government shares information, empowers people with tools to hold the government accountable, and 
fosters citizen participation in public policy deliberations while maintaining an open civic space. This factor measures whether basic laws and information on legal 
rights are publicized and evaluates the quality of information published by the government.

In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:
    -	Whether requests for information from the public to government agencies and institutions are granted, and if these requests are granted within a reasonable 
    time period, with complete and pertinent answers, at a reasonable cost and without having to pay a bribe for the information.
    -	Whether people are aware of their right to information, and whether relevant records are accessible to the public upon request.
    -	The effectiveness of non-governmental checks on the government’s power, as well as the openness of the civic space and the extent of citizen participation. 
    It includes the effective exercise of the freedoms of assembly, association, opinion, and expression, and the rights to petition and civic engagement.

4. Fundamental Rights
This pillar recognizes that a system of positive law that fails to respect core human rights established under international law is at best “rule by law,” and does not 
deserve to be called a rule of law system. This aspect focuses on rights that are firmly established under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, but 
only includes a relatively small number of rights which are most closely related to rule of law concerns.

In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:
    -	The protection of rights related to dignity, including the prohibition of torture, slavery and forced labor.  
    -	The protection of rights related to freedom, including freedom of thought, conscience, religion, peaceful assembly, association, opinion, and expression, as well 
    as the right to property and to asylum.
    -	Whether civil society organizations are free to comment on government policies, without fear of retaliation. In addition, it also measures if quarantines and 
    lockdowns are applied proportionately, not discriminatory, with limited duration and in accordance with the law.

    foreign investors receive fair and equitable treatment from the government, and the effective enforcement of anti-squatting laws and intellectual property rights.
    -	Whether the government respects the right to asylum and refugees can move freely within the host country, have access to legal work and state services such as education, 
    accommodation, meals, healthcare, and cash benefits, as well as legal documentation and economic opportunities.
    -	The protection of rights related to equality, including equality before the law, and absence of discrimination based on socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, religion, 
    national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

    accused including principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offenses and penalties, and the right not to be tried or punished twice.

5. Security
Measures the assurance of the security of persons and property. Security is one of the defining aspects of any rule of law society and is a fundamental function of the state. It is

In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:
    -	The extent to which people feel safe and secure in their city, town, or village, and in their neighborhood.
    -	The extent to which the State is able to keep crime and violence to minimum levels.

6. Regulatory Enforcement and Enabling Business Environment
Measures the extent to which regulations are fairly and effectively implemented and enforced. Regulations, both legal and administrative, structure behaviors within and outside of the 
government. This factor does not assess which activities a government chooses to regulate, nor does it consider how much regulation of a particular activity is appropriate. Rather, 
it examines how regulations are implemented and enforced.
In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:
    -	The extent to which the legal framework for businesses is clear, accessible, and predictable, as well as the respect for property rights.

7. Civil Justice
Measures whether ordinary people can resolve their grievances through formal institutions of justice in a peaceful and effective manner, as well as in accordance with generally 
accepted social norms rather than resorting to violence or self-help. Access to civil justice requires that the system be accessible, affordable, effective, impartial, and culturally 
competent.

In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:
    -	Whether justice institutions help prevent legal and justice needs. It also measures whether authorities tolerate illegal activities such as squatting, street vending 
    or informal labor arrangements.

    influence from the government and private interests.

8. Criminal Justice
Evaluates a country’s criminal justice system. An effective criminal justice system is a key aspect of the rule of law, as it constitutes the conventional mechanism to redress 
grievances and bring action against individuals for offenses against society. An assessment of the delivery of criminal justice should take into consideration the entire system, 
including the police, lawyers, prosecutors, judges, and prison officers.

    -	Whether criminal investigations are effective, timely, impartial, and free of corruption and undue influence from criminal organizations and political and private 
    interests.
    -	The effectiveness of prosecutors in investigating crimes, and if pre-trial proceedings are timely, outcome-oriented, impartial, and free of corruption and undue influence 
    from political and private interests.

    influence from the government and private interests.
    -	Whether victim’s rights are effectively guaranteed, including treatment with respect, absence of discrimination, timely and sufficient information, and protection.
    -	Whether the basic rights of criminal suspects are respected, including the presumption of innocence and the freedom from arbitrary arrest and unreasonable pre-trial detention. 
    It also measures whether criminal suspects are able to access and challenge evidence used against them, whether they are subject to abusive treatment, and whether they are provided 
    with adequate legal assistance. In addition, it measures whether the basic rights of prisoners are respected once they have been convicted of a crime.
    -	Whether the prison system guarantees conditions of safety and order and respects the rights of people deprived of their liberty. It also measures the absence of corruption and 
    the effectiveness of the prison system in reducing recidivism.

# News article and instructions
Now, given the following news article:
News title: {headline}
News summary: {summary}
News body: {body}

Analyze the news article and its context, and answer the following question:
1.	How related is this news article to each one of the pillars of the Rule of Law? Produce a score for each pillar ranging from 1 to 10, where 10 reflects that the news article is 
HIGHLY related to a specific pillar, and 0 meaning that the news article is TOTALLY UNRELATED to a given pillar.

Use the following JSON format to structure your answer:
    {{
        "pillars_relation": answer to the question number 1. Answer using a list where each element of the list is a dictionary like this: 
        {{'[number of pillar]. name of pillar': relevance score as an integer number}}
    }}

IMPORTANT: As you saw, each pillar measures a wide range of elements, and they tend to overlap in various aspects. On the other hand, the news articles describe events that take 
place in a specific country, territory, or region. Therefore, a pillar being related to a news article means that the events narrated by the article can be measured by that pillar, 
or that the events happening in the news article would have an impact on that pillar, either positive, negative, or neutral.
Remember to ONLY answer following the JSON format explained above.

When answering, strictly attach to the definitions of the Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance that I provided above and keep in mind the following points:
    1. We do not include the right to access to healthcare in the conceptual framework of the Rule of Law because we are not contacting public health experts in this project, so news 
    articles which main topic is the right to healthcare should not be related to the Rule of Law.
    2. It is very important to distinguish between different types of news: description of events, interviews, op-eds, public statements, to clarify whether the news article has any 
    actual impact on the Rule of Law, Justice, or Governance.
    3. Opinion columns and opinion articles in general should not be related to the Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance.
    4. We are only interested in current or recent events related to the Rule of Law. Therefore, please exclude historical events in the far past.
    5. Any news article referring to foreign policy or international diplomacy should be labeled as unrelated to the Rule of Law.
    There is a very important key point to keep in mind:
    Our conceptual framework does NOT include war, armed conflict, or peace agreements. Therefore, news articles narrating events that derive from war, armed conflict, or peace 
    agreements, or events that are a direct consequence from the previous situations should NOT be related to the Rule of Law.
    Remember to ONLY answer following the JSON format explained above.
