The demonstrations in Austria are supported by numerous civil society and political organizations and aim to defend democracy and human rights.\n",
      "- The Austrian government has proposed an amendment to the road traffic regulations that would make it easier for municipalities to reduce speed limits in areas with sensitive locations such as schools, playgrounds, and hospitals. This change would give local authorities more control over traffic safety and allow them to better protect vulnerable road users.\n",
      "- The news article reports on the successful arrest of a dangerous prisoner who had escaped in Holland by the Federal Criminal Police Office (BK) in Vienna-Schwechat. The arrest is part of the BK's ongoing efforts to track down and apprehend wanted criminals, with a focus on serious crimes such as murder, robbery, kidnapping, and drug trafficking. The BK's target search unit, which operates worldwide, has a high success rate, having arrested 311 out of 313 wanted individuals since its establishment in 2003. The arrest of the escaped prisoner demonstrates the effectiveness of the BK's target search unit and its commitment to protecting the public from dangerous criminals.\n",

The exhibition traces the historical path from the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy to the takeover of power by the National Socialists, showcasing the increasing military armament of party-affiliated organizations and the radicalization that led to violence and deaths. It also examines the voting mishap that ultimately led to the elimination of parliament and the corporate state. The exhibition serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, assembly, and association, and the need to combat discrimination and exclusion.\n",
      "- The film \"Persona Non Grata\" is based on the true story of ex-ski racer Nicola Werdenigg, who in 2017 made public serious grievances about sexual violence and systematic abuse of power during her active career, triggering a MeToo wave in Austrian skiing. The film focuses on the psychological impact of the abuse and the decades-long silence surrounding it.\n",

The article highlights the importance of addressing these issues and the progress that has been made in recent years, particularly through the #MeToo movement and the establishment of support organizations like *vera. The film's director, Antonin Svoboda, and lead actress, Gerti Drassl, emphasize the need to create awareness about these issues and to challenge societal norms that perpetuate abuse of power and sexual violence.\n",
      "- The Higher Regional Court (OLG) Graz has ended the investigation against two brothers originally from Syria and the “Liga Kultur” associations in Graz and Vienna that were attributed to them. The Graz public prosecutor's office had been investigating the two since mid-March 2020 as part of Operation “Luxor” and suspected them of having helped set up the organization of the Austrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood and the terrorist Hamas between October 2002 and November 2020. The investigation was discontinued due to lack of evidence to support the allegations. The court found no basis for the suspicion that the brothers led terrorist organizations, were members of criminal organizations, or were involved in anti-state connections in Austria.\n",
      "- The European Court of Justice has ruled that adult refugees, under certain conditions, have the right to asylum and residence. This ruling is binding for Austria and gives a broad interpretation of the right to asylum.\n",
      "- The Austrian government has approved a new Monument Protection Act that will strengthen the protection of historical buildings and monuments.

The restoration of rivers will enhance biodiversity, improve water quality, and provide flood protection, benefiting both ecosystems and human communities.\n",
      "- Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen used International Women's Day to highlight the issue of violence against women, particularly femicide, and called on men to take responsibility for addressing it. He also drew attention to the gender pay gap and the need for greater equality for women.\n",

      "- In Austria, a study reveals that approximately 11,000 girls and women are affected by female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), with up to 3,000 young girls at risk. The study highlights the prevalence of this harmful practice among certain migrant communities, particularly those from Egypt and Somalia. The government has established a nationwide coordination office to combat FGM/C through educational and prevention initiatives, including outreach to men to address the patriarchal roots of the issue. The article underscores the government's commitment to protecting women and girls from this form of gender-based violence and promoting their fundamental rights and freedoms.\n",
      "- The Constitutional Court of Austria has ruled that police will need a judge's approval to confiscate cell phones, overturning a previous regulation that allowed investigative authorities to seize devices even for minor crimes. This decision strengthens the protection of privacy and freedom of communication, as it prevents law enforcement from arbitrarily seizing and searching personal devices without proper legal authorization.\n",
      "- The Supreme Court of Austria has ruled that the seizure of cell phones without prior judicial approval is unconstitutional, violating the right to privacy and data protection. This decision has a positive impact on the Fundamental Freedoms pillar, as it strengthens the protection of privacy and data rights. The ruling requires that a judge must approve the seizure and determine which data can be evaluated for investigative purposes, balancing the public interest in criminal prosecution with the fundamental rights of the individual.\n",
      "- In Styria, Austria, twelve women have been killed by men this year. In response, the Violence Protection Advisory Board of the State of Styria has developed a six-point plan to enhance protection against violence. The plan includes establishing a central emergency number for violence protection facilities and raising awareness among the judiciary and police. These measures aim to strengthen the protection of women's rights and combat violence against women, thereby contributing to the promotion of fundamental freedoms and equality.\n",
      "- The right-wing FPÖ party in Austria has been ordered to pay 13,000 euros to Climate Protection Minister Leonore Gewessler for defamation. The FPÖ had spread a picture montage on social media showing a sleeping woman at the 2022 climate summit in Egypt, falsely claiming it was Gewessler. The Graz Higher Regional Court ruled that the FPÖ's actions violated Gewessler's right to freedom of expression and reputation.\n",
      "- The Austrian government has agreed on a new draft to abolish official secrecy and introduce a freedom of information law.

The public prosecutor's office decided not to take legal action, as the APA confirmed on Monday.

At that time, the activists poured green dye into the fountain. This almost led to the first criminal trial in Vienna against members of the “Last Generation” in connection with protests. But the proceedings were discontinued. The court's decision is being followed, said a spokeswoman for the APA public prosecutor's office. At the protest of the “Last Generation” on the morning of this year’s 4th. In May, the dye uranine, known from previous campaigns, was used again. According to the court, after the action, total costs of 807.82 euros were incurred for “natural stone work” and an analysis of the water. Although the dye dissolved the same day, the public prosecutor's office brought a case on April 4th. In July, a criminal complaint was filed against the two activists for serious damage to property and accused them of “defacing a public monument.” The court has now rejected a possible trial and argued, among other things, that the chemical would dissolve quickly. “On May 4th, the water in the well was sampled for further testing for uranine. The sample was taken to the laboratory, and upon examination the sample was already clear and colorless and showed no cloudiness,” it says in the 20. July-dated decision that is available to the APA. Uranine is also a completely harmless substance that only causes a short-term coloring of the water, the letter states, citing the laboratory report. “In addition, the costs incurred are low and leaving out the water is not absolutely necessary due to its complete harmlessness and lack of hazard-related properties.” According to the court, no serious damage to property was apparent.

Zadic announced that this should include guardianship proceedings, custody regulations, family proceedings and also the issue of violence. \"That could take some time.\" Child support should already be given higher priority with the guidelines for family courts. This is a psychosocially trained companion with a lot of experience working with children. “In the Ministry of Justice we want child advocates to be used as often as possible,” which is why the new guidelines set out when it is advisable to call in one, Zadic explained. Child support is \"an important instrument\" and a \"gentle and age-appropriate support\" with which the court can include the \"voice of the child\" in its decision, said Hedwig Wölfl, managing director of the child protection organization \"Die Möwe\". “We are also experiencing a paradigm shift that we really like.” With the reform of child custody law, the involvement of a child guardian will then be mandatory, assured Zadic. However, family judge Christine Miklau pointed out that an increase in budgetary and human resources would also be necessary. According to Zadic, certain principles apply in family law. “But we have to make it very clear that in the event of violence, many of these specific principles, which can otherwise be very helpful in family law proceedings, are no longer valid,” said the minister. This includes the assumption that contact with both parents is always in the best interests of the child. “If violence is involved, that is no longer valid; you have to look at everything carefully on a case-by-case basis,” said Zadic. \"Every child has the right to grow up free of violence.\" Andrea Brem, managing director of the Vienna women's shelters, described the reform of child custody law ten years ago, where joint custody was established, as a \"step backwards\". Because where there is domestic violence, shared custody is “anything but practical”. The statement that children always have a right to both parents in the event of divorce has led to massive problems in the area of ​​violence. Severely abused women are required to leave their husbands to protect themselves and their children. “In the course of the custody process, however, it can still happen that the same women are required to share custody with the perpetrator. In this case, the perpetrator still has the opportunity to terrorize the woman and to exploit and put pressure on the children,\" said Brem. The guidelines now explain why joint custody in the case of domestic violence is neither in the best interests of the child nor is it reasonable for mothers who have been affected by massive domestic violence. “Every encounter with the threat agent increases the feeling of fear,” said Brem. It would often take up to six months for those affected to calm down after they have been physically removed from the danger zone. Brem also welcomed the fact that the topic of psychological violence had now been included in this directive. Family judge Miklau also reports from her experience that it is always necessary to actively ask victims of domestic violence about insults or humiliation, because they often do not consider this to be legally relevant.\n",
