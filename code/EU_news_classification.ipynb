    "# Key macro concepts\n",
    "Here are the definitions of Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance:\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Rule of Law?\n",
    "The term Rule of Law refers to a system in which law is able to impose meaningful restraints on the state and individual \n",
    "members of the ruling elite. It refers to a governance principle in which all persons, institutions, and entities, public \n",
    "and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, and \n",
    "independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "We extend this concept further by defining the Rule of Law as a rules-based system in which the following four universal \n",
    "principles are upheld. First, the government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law. Second, the laws \n",
    "are clear, publicized, stable, and fair, and protect fundamental rights, including the security of persons and property. \n",
    "Third, the process by which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced is accessible, fair, and efficient. Lastly, \n",
    "access to justice is provided by competent, independent, and ethical adjudicators, attorneys or representatives, and \n",
    "judicial officers who are of sufficient number, have adequate resources, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the previous definitions, we can infer that the Rule of Law is a multidimensional concept that extends over eight \n",
    "basic pillars: limited government powers; absence of corruption; order and security; fundamental rights; open government; \n",
    "effective regulatory enforcement; access to civil justice; and an effective criminal justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a political science perspective, these factors draw on four basic ideas related to the relationship between the state \n",
    "and the civil society: the checks and balances on the government's power, the effectiveness of the state in performing its \n",
    "basic functions, participation and collaboration between the state and its citizens, and absence of arbitrary abuse by the \n",
    "authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Justice?\n",
    "We define Justice as the ethical, philosophical idea that people are to be treated impartially, fairly, properly, \n",
    "and reasonably by the law and by arbiters of the law, that laws are to ensure that no harm befalls another, and that, \n",
    "where harm is alleged, a remedial action is taken - both the accuser and the accused receive a morally right \n",
    "consequence merited by their actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justice also refers more specifically to the set of institutions and services that allow for the impartial mediation \n",
    "and adjudication of disputes arising from the violation or conflicting interpretations of laws, including the enforcement \n",
    "of decisions or agreements reached through their operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Governance?\n",
    "Finally, we define Governance as the mechanisms, processes, and structures through which public institutions operate and \n",
    "make decisions for the welfare and benefit of their respective communities. This encompasses the way governments and local \n",
    "authorities are organized, how policies are formulated and implemented, how resources are allocated and managed, and how \n",
    "public services are delivered to citizens.\n",
    "\n",

    "clarify whether the news article has any actual impact on the Rule of Law, Justice, or Governance.\n",
    "3. Opinion columns and opinion articles in general should not be related to the Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance.\n",
    "There is a very important key point to keep in mind:\n",
    "Our conceptual framework does NOT include war, armed conflict, or peace agreements. Therefore, news articles narrating events that derive \n",

    "Next, I will provide you with detailed definitions for each pillar.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pillars of the Rule of Law\n",
    "1. Constraints on Government Powers: \n",
    "    Measures the extent to which those who govern are bound by law. It comprises the means, both constitutional and institutional, by which the powers of the \n",
    "    government and its officials and agents are limited and held accountable under the law. It also includes non-governmental checks on the government’s power, \n",
    "    such as a free and independent press. Additionally, it measures the absence of authoritarianism, which includes the accountability of the Chief Executive, \n",
    "    and its respect for checks and balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",
    "    -\tThe active and reactive transparency of legislative bodies (senate, parliament, assemblies), its ability to impose disciplinary measures to government \n",
    "    officials, and if there is representation of disadvantaged groups, as well as citizen participation. It also measures if the opposition can express its \n",
    "    opinions and if it exercises its functions of overseeing and investigating the government.\n",

    "    -\tThe effectiveness of non-governmental checks on the government’s power, such as the media, CSOs, political parties, activists, and citizens. It includes their \n",
    "    effective exercise of the freedoms of assembly, association, opinion, and expression, and the rights to petition and civic engagement.\n",
    "    -\tThe accountability of the Chief Executive or the Head of Government, and its respect for the constitutional order, the law-making process, the outcome and quality \n",
    "    of elections, civil liberties, political opponents, as well as the independence of the judiciary and oversight institutions. It also measures the likelihood of \n",
    "    sanctions to officials for misconduct.\n",
    "    -\tWhether members of the legislature, judiciary, elected leaders or high-ranking government officials, public sector employees, and police officers, who abuse their \n",
    "    power are sanctioned for misconduct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Constraints on Government Powers:\n",
    "Measures the control of corruption in various forms: bribery in administrative and political proceedings, graft, embezzlement, fraud, payroll fraud, asset misappropriation \n",
    "and skimming, nepotism, favoritism, patronage, illegal campaign financing, electoral fraud and vote buying.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",
    "    -\tThe prevalence of bribery in the delivery of public services and regulations, as well as in the political process. \n",
    "    -\tThe prevalence of graft by elected officials, public sector employees, by awarding contracts without competitive bidding processes, exerting influence for their \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Open Government\n",
    "Measures the openness of government defined by the extent to which a government shares information, empowers people with tools to hold the government accountable, and \n",
    "fosters citizen participation in public policy deliberations while maintaining an open civic space. This factor measures whether basic laws and information on legal \n",
    "rights are publicized and evaluates the quality of information published by the government.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",
    "    -\tWhether requests for information from the public to government agencies and institutions are granted, and if these requests are granted within a reasonable \n",

    "\n",
    "4. Fundamental Rights\n",
    "This pillar recognizes that a system of positive law that fails to respect core human rights established under international law is at best “rule by law,” and does not \n",
    "deserve to be called a rule of law system. This aspect focuses on rights that are firmly established under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, but \n",
    "only includes a relatively small number of rights which are most closely related to rule of law concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",
    "    -\tThe protection of rights related to dignity, including the prohibition of torture, slavery and forced labor.  \n",
    "    -\tThe protection of rights related to freedom, including freedom of thought, conscience, religion, peaceful assembly, association, opinion, and expression, as well \n",

    "    lockdowns are applied proportionately, not discriminatory, with limited duration and in accordance with the law.\n",
    "    -\tWhether independent media, civil society organizations, members of the opposition, opposing factions of the governing party, activists, whistleblowers, and \n",
    "    individuals are free to report and comment on government policies, without fear of retaliation.\n",
    "    -\tThe extent to which the media publish credible fact-checked information, and if its editorial content is independent from political influences, as well as if it \n",
    "    can conduct investigations and expose cases of corruption without facing surveillance, harassment, threats, legal actions, or administrative sanctions.\n",
    "    -\tThe extent to which the government allows the formation or operation of CSOs, and the formation or operation of opposition parties.\n",
    "    -\tWhether the government respects the property rights of people and corporations, refrains from the illegal seizure of private property, and provides adequate reasons \n",
    "    and compensation when property is legally expropriated. It also measures if the process for transferring a property is simple and quick. In addition, it measures if \n",
    "    foreign investors receive fair and equitable treatment from the government, and the effective enforcement of anti-squatting laws and intellectual property rights.\n",
    "    -\tWhether the government respects the right to asylum and refugees can move freely within the host country, have access to legal work and state services such as education, \n",
    "    accommodation, meals, healthcare, and cash benefits, as well as legal documentation and economic opportunities.\n",
    "    -\tThe protection of rights related to equality, including equality before the law, and absence of discrimination based on socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, religion, \n",

    "    elections, to information, petition, movement, and of residence.\n",
    "    -\tThe protection of rights related to justice, including the right to effective remedy and to a fair trial, presumption of innocence, and to defense, as well as rights of the \n",
    "    accused including principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offenses and penalties, and the right not to be tried or punished twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Security\n",
    "Measures the assurance of the security of persons and property. Security is one of the defining aspects of any rule of law society and is a fundamental function of the state. It is \n",
    "also a precondition for the realization of the rights and freedoms that the rule of law seeks to advance. We are excluding armed conflict from this pillar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",
    "    -\tThe extent to which people feel safe and secure in their city, town, or village, and in their neighborhood.\n",
    "    -\tThe extent to which the State is able to keep crime and violence to minimum levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Regulatory Enforcement and Enabling Business Environment\n",
    "Measures the extent to which regulations are fairly and effectively implemented and enforced. Regulations, both legal and administrative, structure behaviors within and outside of the \n",
    "government. This factor does not assess which activities a government chooses to regulate, nor does it consider how much regulation of a particular activity is appropriate. Rather, \n",
    "it examines how regulations are implemented and enforced.\n",
    "In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",
    "    -\tThe extent to which the legal framework for businesses is clear, accessible, and predictable, as well as the respect for property rights.\n",
    "    -\tWhether the government respects the property rights of people and corporations, refrains from the illegal seizure of private property, and \n",
    "    provides adequate reasons and compensation when property is legally expropriated. In addition, it measures if foreign investors receive fair and equitable treatment from the \n",
    "    government, and the effective enforcement of anti-squatting laws and intellectual property rights. \n",
    "    -\tWhether the process for transferring a property is simple and quick. \n",
    "    -\tThe extent to which the government audits and inspections are conducted in accordance with the law and are free of corruption; if complaint mechanisms are simple, accessible, \n",
    "    and cost-effective, and if regulation authorities are impartial, and if they sanction violations.\n",
    "    -\tWhether environmental and labor regulation authorities sanction violations, such as occupational safety and business license or zoning violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Civil Justice\n",
    "Measures whether ordinary people can resolve their grievances through formal institutions of justice in a peaceful and effective manner, as well as in accordance with generally \n",
    "accepted social norms rather than resorting to violence or self-help. Access to civil justice requires that the system be accessible, affordable, effective, impartial, and culturally \n",
    "competent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",
    "    -\tWhether justice institutions help prevent legal and justice needs. It also measures whether authorities tolerate illegal activities such as squatting, street vending \n",
    "    or informal labor arrangements.\n",
    "    -\tWhether people are aware of their rights, formal justice, and alternative justice mechanisms, and know where to get information and advice when facing a legal problem.\n",
    "    -\tWhether can access and afford legal advice and representation; and can access the court system without incurring unreasonable fees.\n",
    "    -\tWhether the civil justice system is impartial and free of discrimination, corruption and undue influence from the government and private interests.\n",
    "    -\tThe effectiveness and timeliness of the enforcement of civil justice decisions and judgments in practice.\n",
    "    -\tWhether alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (ADRs) are available, accessible, affordable, impartial, timely, effective, enforceable, and free of corruption and undue \n",
    "    influence from the government and private interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Criminal Justice\n",
    "Evaluates a country’s criminal justice system. An effective criminal justice system is a key aspect of the rule of law, as it constitutes the conventional mechanism to redress \n",
    "grievances and bring action against individuals for offenses against society. An assessment of the delivery of criminal justice should take into consideration the entire system, \n",
    "including the police, lawyers, prosecutors, judges, and prison officers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",
    "    -\tWhether criminal investigations are effective, timely, impartial, and free of corruption and undue influence from criminal organizations and political and private \n",
    "    interests.\n",
    "    -\tThe effectiveness of prosecutors in investigating crimes, and if pre-trial proceedings are timely, outcome-oriented, impartial, and free of corruption and undue influence \n",
    "    from political and private interests.\n",
    "    -\tWhether trials are timely, outcome-oriented, impartial, and free of corruption and undue influence from political and private interests.\n",
    "    -\tWhether alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (ADRs) are available, accessible, affordable, impartial, timely, effective, enforceable, and free of corruption and undue \n",
    "    influence from the government and private interests.\n",
    "    -\tWhether victim’s rights are effectively guaranteed, including treatment with respect, absence of discrimination, timely and sufficient information, and protection.\n",
    "    -\tWhether the basic rights of criminal suspects are respected, including the presumption of innocence and the freedom from arbitrary arrest and unreasonable pre-trial detention. \n",
    "    It also measures whether criminal suspects are able to access and challenge evidence used against them, whether they are subject to abusive treatment, and whether they are provided \n",
    "    with adequate legal assistance. In addition, it measures whether the basic rights of prisoners are respected once they have been convicted of a crime.\n",
    "    -\tWhether the prison system guarantees conditions of safety and order and respects the rights of people deprived of their liberty. It also measures the absence of corruption and \n",
    "    the effectiveness of the prison system in reducing recidivism.\n",
